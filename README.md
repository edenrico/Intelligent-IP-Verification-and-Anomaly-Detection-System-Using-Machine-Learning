Intelligent IP Verification and Anomaly Detection System Using Machine Learning


I developed a Python project incorporating machine learning for IP verification and anomaly detection. The system is designed to analyze network traffic and identify potentially malicious IPs. It integrates several advanced tools and technologies, including Nmap for network scanning, an IP API for real-time verification, and packet capture mechanisms to monitor and assess data flows. The machine learning component enables the system to learn from patterns in network behavior, improving its ability to detect anomalies over time. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was created to facilitate interaction, making the tool accessible for network security analysis and threat detection. This project is a comprehensive solution aimed at enhancing cybersecurity by providing automated, intelligent monitoring of network traffic.
